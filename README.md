# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Python using the tkinter library for the graphical user interface.

## How to Play

1. Run the `tic_tac_toe.py` script.
2. Click on any empty cell to place your symbol (X or O).
3. The game will automatically switch between players (X and O).
4. The first player to form a straight line of their symbols (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
5. If all cells are filled and no player has formed a straight line, the game ends in a draw.

## Features
